I am currently a senior CS PhD candidate at [Dartmouth College](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu), advised by [Prof. Andrew Campbell](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/). Previously, I was a Student Researcher at [Google](https://blog.google/technology/health/) (Summer 2025) and a research intern at [Nokia Bell Labs (Cambridge, UK)](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/locations/cambridge-uk/#gref) (Summer 2024). From 2019-2021, I was an AI & Data Graduate Scientist at [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/).

My interdisciplinary research centers on developing machine learning techniques to study health in real-world settings, utilizing data from wearable devices and mobile phone sensors. In particular, I am interested in these areas:

1. **Health Foundation Models**: Developing models that can generalize to many tasks is crucial for healthcare. To this end, I have developed PaPaGei, which is the first open-source foundation model for Photoplethysmography (PPG) [[ICLR'25]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20542); And proposed Time2Lang, which is a framework to integrate time-series foundation models with LLMs [[CHIL'25]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07608).

2. **Un/Semi-supervised Learning**: I developed a method to detect rare life events from multi-modal sensing data [[CHIL'23]](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v209/pillai23a.html). Additionally, I have also proposed a domain adaptation method and investigated the generalization of speech-based suicidal ideation detection [[UbiComp'24a]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3631452).

3. **Behavior Modelling using Mobile Systems**: I develop machine learning models and contribute to mobile systems targeted at understanding mental health. In this area, I have developed models for depression detection from in-the-wild smartphone images [[CHI'24]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642680), an intervention system for improving social interactions in individuals with schizophrenia [[IEEE PerCom Magazine'24]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10485570), and maintain large-scale datasets with over 3 years of continuous sensing data [[UbiComp'24b]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3643501).
