I am a 4th year PhD student at [Dartmouth College](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu), advised by [Prof. Andrew Campbell](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/).
Previously, I was a research intern at [Nokia Bell Labs (Cambridge, UK)](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/locations/cambridge-uk/#gref) (Summer 2024), and 
a AI & Data Graduate Scientist at AstraZeneca (2019-2021).

My interdisciplinary research centers on developing machine learning techniques to study health in real-world settings, utilizing data from wearable devices and mobile phone sensors. In particular, I am interested in these two areas:

1. **AI for Mental Health**: I develop models from different modalities to evaluate the presence of mental illness symptoms:
(a) rare life events for <ins>sensor</ins> data [[CHIL'23]](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v209/pillai23a.html), 
(b) suicidal ideation detection from <ins>speech</ins> [[UbiComp'24]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3631452), 
and (c) depression detection from front-facing smartphone <ins>images</ins> [[CHI'24]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642680).

1. **ML Genearlizability**: I am interested in analyzing the generalizability of healthcare ML models. To this end, I developed an open foundation model for PPG data that is evaluated on 10 different datasets with varying real-world conditions [[ICLR'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20542)]. I have also proposed a domain adaptation method and investigated the generalization of speech-based suicidal ideation detection [[UbiComp'24]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3631452).
