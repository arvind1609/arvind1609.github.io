I am a 4th year PhD student at [Dartmouth College](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu), advised by [Prof. Andrew Campbell](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/).
Previously, I was a research intern at [Nokia Bell Labs (Cambridge, UK)](https://www.bell-labs.com/about/locations/cambridge-uk/#gref) (Summer 2024), and 
a AI & Data Graduate Scientist at AstraZeneca (2019-2021).

My interdisciplinary research enables the examination of mental health and behavior of individuals through mobile sensing and robust machine learning. In particular, I am interested in 
these two areas:

1. **AI for Mental Health**: I develop models from different modalities to evaluate the presence of mental illness symptoms:
(a) rare life events for <ins>sensor</ins> data [[CHIL'23]](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v209/pillai23a.html), 
(b) suicidal ideation detection from <ins>speech</ins> [[UbiComp'24]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3631452), 
and (c) depression detection from front-facing smartphone <ins>images</ins> [[CHI'24]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642680).

1. **Robust ML**: I like analyzing how healthcare ML models perform when tested against out-of-distribution data. In general, 
these models do not perform well, and proposing algorithms to address this issue is very interesting. 
To this end, I have investigated the generalization of speech-based suicidal ideation detection [[UbiComp'24]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3631452).

**Annoucement:** The [Campbell Lab](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/) is looking to recruit 2-3 PhD students this cycle who will start in Fall 2025. If you're interested in sensing, machine learning, and healthcare, please apply to [Dartmouth's PhD in CS program](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/graduate/applying/phd-computer-science). Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
